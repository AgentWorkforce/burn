# Changelog

All notable changes to `@relayburn/sdk`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- `hotspots({ patterns })` now also surfaces `tool-output-bloat`, `ghost-surface`, and `tool-call-pattern` findings (previously only the core `detectPatterns` set). Each side-channel detector loads its own inputs (Claude settings, tool-result events, on-disk surface) lazily based on the requested patterns.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Initial release with embedded `Ledger.open()`, `ingest()`, `summary()`, and `hotspots()` helpers.
